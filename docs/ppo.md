## Search for a PPO

Search for PPOs using:

If your search finds only one PPO, you'll be taken straight to the details. If your search brings back more than one result, you'll see the results in a table and can click on the one you want.

## Create a new PPO

Click on the 'Create new PPO' button to get started.

On the next screen, use the map to find the location you want. Use your mouse-wheel or the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> buttons to zoom in and out and click and drag to move the map. Click on the map to start drawing your route, and keep clicking along where you want your route to go. Double-click to finish and the line will turn yellow. 

If you make a mistake and want to edit your line, click on the Pencil icon on the map to turn on edit mode - you'll see your line highlighted and each node you drew marked as a red circle. Click and drag on any of the nodes to edit your line or add new nodes as you need.
